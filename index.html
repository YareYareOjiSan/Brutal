                        buildings of the ’50s, was later discarded by the green movement activists, now the worst
                        appearance of these monuments is seen in our city.<br />‍<br />Brutalism is not just a matter of
                        nostalgia. Modernist architecture had been replaced by brutalism – even to those that oppose
                        modernism. This is the first generation to grow up in this environment – people that have
                        nothing to lose, architecture is almost revenge to the architect’s obsession. When in Hungary
                        you can find ten massive examples of the Brutalist movement
                        <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cement, concrete and brick. Brutalist mentality dominates all the
                        cities. A picture doesn’t lie. The buildings in Budapest are all concrete – many of them are
                        shaped like cranes. Even the roofs are straightened to imitate a shot of the movement.Think
                        concrete structures and you think: facades with rough shapes, cement-covered walls, cavernous
                        voids, and rigid columns that can only hold up a roof. But in Europe and especially in the U.K.,
                        concrete shapes are as much about cool sculptural architecture as they are about helping to
                        shape the concrete. The Brutalist movement can be seen throughout Europe, as the region builds
                        and rebuilds itself and its cities from rubble. Like New York and other similar metropoles,
                        cities on the European continent are undergoing rapid growth and renewal, and a shift in public
                        opinion about the notion of expensive and ugly concrete towers. That&#x27;s reflected by
                        Brutalist architecture in London and Paris. In Britain and the U.S., Brutalism mostly fell out
                        of fashion, and mostly with Brutalists themselves.<br /><br />Ironically, one of the earliest
                        major proponents of Brutalist architecture is now a popular choice for contemporary offices:
                        architects like Richard Rogers, Ben Cramer, Richard Caro, Daniel Burstein, the late Gennaro
                        Bettoni, Norman Foster, and others.<br />Brutalism is partly a legacy of the Iron Age, when
                        brick and mortar were the building materials for monumental buildings in Rome and Greece.
                        Brutalists and Modernists alike attacked the fabric of existing architecture.<br />More
                        recently, in the 1960s and early 1970s, Brutalism seemed cool. Architects and artists were
                        mixing concrete with brash colors, echoing elements of ancient civil architecture. Many critics
                        have attacked Brutalism for being disconnected from the realities of ordinary life. The most

                        I had called my work &quot;Brutal&quot;, I am glad that I can now officially apologize for my
                        error. <br /><br />In my books, we call it &quot;Brutalism&quot;, since it is &quot;brutal&quot;
                        to leave the past unmaintained, non-useful, brutal, horrible and ugly.<br />My works are fully
                        compatible with modern architecture, fully compatible with art and beauty and will continue to
                        grow and progress, bringing the most beautiful buildings we can imagine to
                        life.<br /><br /><br /><br />Well, it seems that there has been some misunderstanding. After
                        making numerous claims about my work that were meant to suggest that I didn&#x27;t know what
                        &quot;Brutalist&quot; was, I have now heard the opposite of the lie that the word is merely to
                        cover all of modern architecture. My work is not &quot;Brutal&quot; and has never been. Not in
                        my words, not in my personal collection of pictures, nor in my studio&#x27;s walls or
                        files.<br />‍<br /><br /><br />Some Brutalist buildings are brutal and hard, a fact that often
                        surprises tourists. You see it all the time on urban tours of Paris and London, from the
                        brutalist metal-and-concrete door of the Central Telegraph Building at Whitechapel in London to
                        the brutalist concrete of the Bankside Power Station in London. In New York City, while the
                        taller ones seem like they&#x27;re designed in concrete, the staircases are actually in concrete
                        and the floors are made of concrete. <br /><br />Brutalism is also built for brutalities. The
                        concrete walls and ceilings can be painfully cold, and the decor adds to the brutalism. The
                        London MuseumMore accurately, Brutalist buildings often are dramatic with their monumental
                        concrete surfaces, challenging architecture critics and developers to come up with memorable,
                        non-concrete forms. <br /></h2>
